# Data-Science-Blog-Post---StackOverflow-Data
Udacity project - Write a Data Science Blog Post - StackOverflow Data

1- Business Understanding


Main questions answered:

-What is the distribution of each developer type around the globe?

-What is the difference in operating system adoption between years 2020 and 2021?

-What are the estimated costs for the next two years for our first teams of developers?


2- Data Understanding

[Stack Overflow Survey - Multiple Years](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)

This is the dataset we chose. It contains insights into the developer community around the world. Each row represent a responded and the values responded to each survey question.

3- Prepare Data

Wrangling the data was not an easy task. The common columns in the datasets often were in a different format that we needed or contained differences in data types between each other.

4- Data Modeling

We analyzed StackOverflow survey data from 2020 and 20201. The aim of the notebook in the repository is to aggregate the data from both survey datasets using their common columns.

5- Evaluate the Results

The conclusions for each question are detailed in [this blog post](https://medium.com/@tudosedotstefan/first-steps-in-recruiting-for-a-web-development-business-d1790e537e25) 
  
Short conlusions can be found below:
  
-What is the distribution of each developer type around the globe? 

This is by far the most fascinating insight. Developer types are mostly equally ditributed in each country around the globe.

-What is the difference in operating system adoption between years 2020 and 2021?

Thinking myself that developers tend to lean on Linux-based and MacOS operating systems, it was a suprise to find that both in 2020 and 2021, Windows has been the predominant developer environment.

-What are the estimated costs for the next two years for our first teams of developers?

We found that we need to spend around 450.000 USD in the first year and if we were to expand our teams, we need to chip in another 310.000 USD on top the next year.
